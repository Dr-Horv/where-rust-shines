# Where Rust shines
A workshop to learn `Java{,script}` developers to write more robust code by showing how Rust forces you to do so.

## Tasks
The repository is separated into a number of tasks that all illustrate common and easy to make mistakes in Java. There is also a matching Rust-project that illustrates how Rust, through its focus on building robust software prevents these mistakes.

## Required environment
You need:
- **A text editor with support for Rust**, the recommndation is to use Visual Studio Code with the Rust(RLS) extension, since you will also be looking at (but not writing) Java code, install the Java-extension for Visual Studio Code as well;
- **Java**;
- **Maven**;
- Rust, install the latest stable version via [rustup](https://www.rustup.rs/).
